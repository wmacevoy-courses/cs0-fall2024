# CS0 - Lab - Variables and Std IO - ASCII Art

Possible points: 100

## Variables and Std IO Lab: ASCII Art

Write a Python program that displays some ASCII arts on to the Console/Terminal or standard output using variables.

### Lab Instructions

1.	Setup GitHub account if not done already; follow instructions in Lab 0
2.	Open your repo folder (CS0Lab-…) in Visual Studio Code
3.	Create a lab folder: ascii
4.	Inside ascii folder, create a new file: main.py
7.	Type the code stub in main.py file as a hint to complete the lab
8.	Never copy-paste code; you’ll not learn anything by doing so!
9.	Type each line of code and use incremental development techniques to learn what the given code does and what happens when you add each line(s) of new code to complete your lab.
6.	Do git add, commit and push as often as possible after every significant improvement or after each fixme is fixed and tested so you are familiar with the git commands, and you have a working backup.
10.	Add files to local git repo then commit and push to remote.
  *	$ git add main.py
  *	$ git commit -m “create main.py file”
  *	$ git push
10.	Fix all the FIXMEs and write #fixed# at the end of each FIXME that’s fixed except at the end of your name and date.
11.	The completed lab should produce an output that looks like the following:
a.	Note: replace the placeholder < > with actual value/data.

```  
   |\_/|       *****************************     (\_/)
  / @ @ \      *        ASCII Lab          *    (='.'=)
 ( > 0 < )     *       <Your Name>         *  ( " )_( " )
   >>x<<       *     <Semester Year>       *
  /  O  \      *        CSCI 111           *
               *****************************
```

Note: The figure on the right (looks like a mouse) uses both single ( ' ) and double quotes ( " ) and you must find a way to print both single and double quotes as shown.

12.	Create a screenshot of the completed program with the final output displayed on the console and save it inside the same ascii folder. (10 points)
13.	When done, update your README file (10 points) as shown here: https://github.com/rambasnet/csci000-astudent
14.	All FIXMEs are worth equal points unless stated otherwise.

## Submission

Add all the relevant source file(s), documents, and screenshots into the correct lab folder and do a final add, commit, and push before the due date.

```bash
$ git pull
$ git status
$ git add <filename>… - add each file in the red that is part of this lab
$ git status
$ git commit -m “Final Submission”
$ git push
$ git status
```

- Check and make sure the files are actually pushed to your GitHub repo on github.com.
NOTE: Do not add and commit to this lab folder after the due date as it may be considered late submission!
